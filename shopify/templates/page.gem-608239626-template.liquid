<h3>What is co-washing?</h3>
<p>Co-washing or conditioner washing is a method of washing your hair with a conditioner designed to cleanse. This process gently rids hair of dirt, excess oils, and product build-up without the use of sulfate detergents that can strip hair and cause damage. This leaves hair healthy, shiny, and more manageable.</p>

<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">It didn't lather, am I doing it wrong? </span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">No, we’re not washing dishes! Traditional shampoos are packed with foaming agents to give you the bubbly effect you’re used to.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span> </span></span>We nixed these chemicals because they are drying and can cause damage to hair.</span></p>

<br>What if my hair is really really dirty, or I have build up after using the Bio-Cleanse? </h3>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Just use our Anti-Residue Cleanse. Unlike other brands, Unwash</span><span class="s2">®</span><span class="s1"><span> </span>offers all the benefits of co-washing with the unique ability to push the “reset” button when hair and scalp need a deeper clean. The Anti-Residue Cleanse is a mild and effective cleanser that removes build-up and excess oil and should be used in place of the Bio-Cleansing Conditioner at least once a week as part of a regular co-wash regimen.</span></p>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1"><span>Why should I make the switch from shampoo?</span></span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span>Most shampoos contain harsh detergents that strip hair of the natural, beneficial oils that protect, moisturize, and add shine.</span><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span> </span></span><span>This leads to a flaky scalp and brittle strands.</span><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span> </span></span><span>To add back the health that shampoo has washed away, conventional haircare regimens have us hooked on conditioner. That’s TWO products for ONE purpose: cleansing hair without drying it out.</span></span></p>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1"><span>Will it make my hair greasy?</span></span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span>No, our Bio-Cleansing Conditioner gently washes away dirt and excess oil. Over time, co-washing will actually help balance your scalp’s oil production to its ideal state. If you feel your hair is getting heavy or limp with excess oil or buildup, you may be using too much product per wash or be in need of a deep cleanse. You can “reset” your hair and scalp using our Anti-Residue Cleanse &amp; Hydrating Masque without undoing all of the great benefits our Bio-Cleansing Conditioner has done.</span></span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1"><span><strong>I have color-treated and/or processed hair (perm, straightening, etc). Can I use Unwash products? </strong><br></span></span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span>Yes. 100% yes. Our products are beloved by professional hairstylists and colorists because <strong>all of our products</strong> are so good for all hair types, and can help extend the life of the treatment on your hair, while keeping your hair strong and healthy at the same time. When you use the wrong cleansing products on your hair, it will fade your hair color more rapidly, dull the shine, and shorten the life span of the treatment. Don't sabotage your balayage or pastel hair dreams.</span></span></p>
